# Spike_Sorting
# A simple code for spike sorting.

The spikes are detected based on a predefined threshold.  
The detected spikes are clustered according to their shape characteristics.

## A demo of the gui 
![demo](https://github.com/sun2009ban/Spike_Sorting/blob/version2.0/demo.png)

## Requests
matplotlib  
tkinter  
numpy  

## Usage
python gui.py

threshod: set the amplitude threhold for detecting spikes.  
overlap (the name will be changed in the next version): the minimum distance between two spikes.    
cluster: the number of clusters in clustering the spikes   

## ToDo
Fixing the bugs!!!!!
